# RD_WGS84_SQL
Function to convert RijksDriehoekcoördinaten (RD) to Latitude-Longitude (WGS84) coordinates.

The RD coordinate system is widely used in The Netherlands. The central point of the grid is the Lange Jan church tower in Amersfoort. This is why the system is called the Amersfoort Coördinaten Systeem as well.

The SQL function is written for T-SQL and proved to be precise enough to use. But do your own checks and let me know if it can be improved.
